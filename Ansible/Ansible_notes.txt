Let’s begin with Lesson 1: What is Ansible & Why Use It?

✅ What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source automation tool for:

Configuration Management

Application Deployment

Task Automation

IT Orchestration

🔑 Key Features:
Agentless (uses SSH)

Declarative (you define what state you want)

Uses YAML for playbooks (easy to read)

Idempotent (won’t repeat changes unnecessarily)

✅ Prerequisites:
Basic Linux/command line knowledge

Python (Ansible is written in Python)

SSH setup between control node and managed nodes

🚀 Your First Task:
Let’s start by installing Ansible on your machine.

1. Are you using Ubuntu/Linux, macOS, or Windows?
Once I know this, I’ll give you the correct installation steps.

Would you also like to set up a lab with virtual machines or use cloud servers (like AWS) to practice?







You said:
I am using ubuntu and I have one linux locally and one linux box in aws 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect! You're in a great position to start — with one local Linux machine and one AWS Linux instance, we can simulate real-world automation between a control node and a managed node.

✅ Step 1: Install Ansible on Your Ubuntu Machine (Control Node)
Run the following commands on your local Ubuntu machine:




sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt install ansible -y
To verify installation:




ansible --version
You should see output confirming Ansible is installed.

✅ Step 2: Set Up SSH Access to AWS Linux Box
Ansible uses SSH to connect to other machines (called managed nodes). You need SSH access set up from your Ubuntu (control node) to your AWS Linux instance.

👉 Steps:
Ensure your AWS instance is running and has a public IP.

On your Ubuntu system:




chmod 400 your-key.pem  # use your actual PEM key from AWS
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<AWS_PUBLIC_IP>
✅ Confirm you can SSH in successfully.

Now add the host to your Ansible inventory.

✅ Step 3: Create an Ansible Inventory File
Create a file called inventory.ini:

ini


[aws]
aws-node ansible_host=<AWS_PUBLIC_IP> ansible_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/path/to/your-key.pem
Replace <AWS_PUBLIC_IP> and the path to your .pem key accordingly.

✅ Step 4: Test the Connection
Run this command:




ansible -i inventory.ini aws -m ping
You should see:

json


aws-node | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
This means Ansible can now talk to your AWS node 🎉

Would you like to proceed with writing your first playbook next? Or would you prefer to explore more ad-hoc commands first for some quick wins?

You said:

ubuntu@3.94.86.165: Permission denied (publickey).
ChatGPT said:
Thanks for the update! The error:

graphql


ubuntu@3.94.86.165: Permission denied (publickey).
means SSH is failing to authenticate using the provided public key. Let's walk through how to fix it.

✅ Step-by-Step Fix
🔍 Step 1: Confirm the SSH Username
The default username for AWS EC2 depends on the AMI (Amazon Machine Image):

OS/AMI	Username
Amazon Linux	ec2-user
Ubuntu	ubuntu
CentOS	centos
Debian	admin
Red Hat	ec2-user

If you're using an Ubuntu AMI, the username should be ubuntu.
If you're using Amazon Linux, it should be ec2-user.

✅ Step 2: Test SSH from the terminal
Run:




ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@3.94.86.165
OR




ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@3.94.86.165
➡️ Replace /path/to/your-key.pem with the actual path to your PEM file.

If one of these works, that's the username you should use in your Ansible inventory.

If both fail, double-check:

The key file matches the one used to launch the EC2 instance

The EC2 security group allows inbound SSH (port 22) from your IP

🔧 Step 3: Update Your Ansible Inventory File
Assuming ubuntu is the correct username and the key is mykey.pem, your inventory.ini should look like this:

ini


[aws]
aws-node ansible_host=3.94.86.165 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/Downloads/mykey.pem
Test it:




ansible -i inventory.ini aws -m ping
Let me know:

The AMI you launched (Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, etc.)

The username you used when launching SSH manually

Whether you're still facing the error after trying these steps

Once we fix the SSH access, we can continue with your first playbook.

You said:
I want use pub key method 
ChatGPT said:
Excellent choice! Using public key authentication is the recommended and secure way to access Linux systems — and Ansible works smoothly with it.

Let’s configure SSH public key access between your local Ubuntu machine (control node) and your AWS Linux instance (managed node).

✅ Step-by-Step: Set Up SSH Public Key Access
🧩 Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if not already done)
Run on your Ubuntu (local) machine:




ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press enter to accept default file (~/.ssh/id_rsa)

Enter passphrase (optional but recommended)

You now have:

Private key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Public key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

🚀 Step 2: Upload the Public Key to the AWS Instance
If you're currently using a .pem file to access the instance, use it one last time to upload your public key:




ssh -i ~/Downloads/your-aws-key.pem ubuntu@3.94.86.165
Once inside the AWS instance:




mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
Then from your local machine (in a separate terminal), run:




cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -i ~/Downloads/your-aws-key.pem ubuntu@3.94.86.165 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
Then back in the SSH session:




chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
exit
🔍 Step 3: Verify Passwordless SSH
Now from your local Ubuntu:




ssh ubuntu@3.94.86.165
✅ If it logs you in without asking for the PEM file, your public key setup is complete.

📁 Step 4: Update Your Ansible Inventory
Update inventory.ini:

ini


[aws]
aws-node ansible_host=3.94.86.165 ansible_user=ubuntu
Ansible will default to using ~/.ssh/id_rsa for the connection.

🧪 Step 5: Test Ansible Ping



ansible -i inventory.ini aws -m ping
You should get a successful ping back:

json


aws-node | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
Let me know once this is working, and we’ll move on to your first Ansible playbook.

You said:
How to add pulblic key in aws machine
ChatGPT said:
To add your public key to an AWS EC2 Linux instance (so you can use SSH without .pem files), follow the steps below.

✅ Goal
Allow your local machine (Ubuntu) to SSH into your AWS instance using your own public key instead of the .pem file.

🧭 Step-by-Step Guide
🧱 Step 1: Generate a Public/Private Key Pair (if you haven’t already)
On your local Ubuntu machine:




ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
When asked where to save the file, press Enter (it will default to ~/.ssh/id_rsa)

This generates:

Private key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Public key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

🔑 Step 2: Connect to AWS EC2 Using .pem File
Use your existing .pem file (the one AWS gave you when launching the instance):




ssh -i ~/Downloads/your-key.pem ubuntu@<AWS_PUBLIC_IP>
(Replace your-key.pem and <AWS_PUBLIC_IP> with actual values.)

📥 Step 3: Create .ssh Folder & Add Your Public Key
On the AWS EC2 instance terminal (once you're connected):




mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
Now go back to your local machine, and run this to  your public key to the AWS instance:




cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -i ~/Downloads/your-key.pem ubuntu@<AWS_PUBLIC_IP> "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
Then back in the SSH session (or in the same command above), make sure permissions are correct:




chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
✅ Step 4: Test SSH Without .pem File
From your local machine:




ssh ubuntu@<AWS_PUBLIC_IP>
🎉 If this logs you in without asking for the .pem, you’ve successfully set up SSH public key authentication.

🚀 Final Step (for Ansible Inventory)
Now you can update your inventory.ini like this:

ini


[aws]
aws-node ansible_host=<AWS_PUBLIC_IP> ansible_user=ubuntu
Test it:




ansible -i inventory.ini aws -m ping
Let me know once this works — I’ll guide you through writing your first Ansible playbook next!

You said:
[aws]
aws-node ansible_host=<AWS_PUBLIC_IP> ansible_user=ubuntu


Do i have follow this compulssory
ChatGPT said:
Great question!

No, you don’t have to follow that exact format — but you do need to tell Ansible how to connect to your target machine. There are a few flexible ways to do this.

✅ The inventory file is required, but the format is flexible.
Here are your options:

✅ Option 1: Basic Static Inventory (recommended for now)
ini


[aws]
3.94.86.165 ansible_user=ubuntu
If you're using your default SSH key (~/.ssh/id_rsa), this is enough.

✅ Option 2: Host Alias (friendly name)
ini


[aws]
aws-node ansible_host=3.94.86.165 ansible_user=ubuntu
Then you can refer to the host as aws-node in your playbooks or commands. This is useful when you have multiple hosts.

✅ Option 3: Dynamic Inventory
(Not needed now, but powerful for large environments — e.g., fetching EC2 IPs via AWS API)

🎯 Summary
You must define your hosts somewhere, even if it's just an IP address.

You can skip ansible_host= if you're directly listing IPs.

You must specify ansible_user= if it's not your current system username.

🧪 Test Command



ansible -i inventory.ini aws -m ping
Let me know how you want to proceed: basic static inventory is totally fine for learning. Once this works, we’ll start writing your first playbook!

You said:
Can you help me wity asnible ad-hoc to create file on managerd node
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Let's walk through using Ansible ad-hoc commands to create a file on your managed node (your AWS instance).

✅ What Are Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands?
Ad-hoc commands let you run quick tasks without writing a playbook. Perfect for things like:

Creating files

Installing packages

Starting/stopping services

📁 Create a File Using Ansible Ad-Hoc
We'll use the file module.

🧪 Syntax:



ansible <host_group> -i <inventory_file> -m file -a "path=<file_path> state=touch"
🔧 Example (your case):
To create a file named /tmp/testfile.txt on your AWS instance, run:




ansible aws -i inventory.ini -m file -a "path=/tmp/testfile.txt state=touch"
✅ You should see a SUCCESS message.

🔍 Confirm the File on the Managed Node
SSH into the AWS instance:




ssh ubuntu@<AWS_PUBLIC_IP>
Then run:




ls -l /tmp/testfile.txt
You should see the file there.

🧠 Bonus: Create a Directory Instead of a File



ansible aws -i inventory.ini -m file -a "path=/tmp/myfolder state=directory mode=0755"
Let me know if you want to:

Write content into a file

Set ownership/permissions

Use other modules like  or command next

You said:
do i have to aws in commad compulsory
ChatGPT said:
Great question — short answer: no, you don’t have to use aws in the command if you structure your inventory file differently.

Let me explain both options clearly:

✅ Option 1: Group Name Required ([aws] in inventory)
If your inventory.ini looks like this:

ini


[aws]
3.94.86.165 ansible_user=ubuntu
Then you must use aws in the command, because it's the group name:




ansible aws -i inventory.ini -m ping
✅ Option 2: No Group Name — Use IP Directly
If your inventory file looks like this:

ini


3.94.86.165 ansible_user=ubuntu
Then you call Ansible like this:




ansible 3.94.86.165 -i inventory.ini -m ping
💡 You’re now addressing the host directly, so no group name like aws is needed.

✅ Recommendation for You (as you're learning):
Use this in inventory.ini if you want to avoid using group names:

ini


3.94.86.165 ansible_user=ubuntu
Then run commands like:




ansible 3.94.86.165 -i inventory.ini -m file -a "path=/tmp/testfile.txt state=touch"
Let me know which style you'd prefer to use, and I’ll continue guiding you accordingly. Ready to move to writing content inside a file next?

You said:
My inventory file name inventory and it has only ip address
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — thanks for the clarification!

Since your inventory file is named inventory and only contains the IP address like this:

ini


3.94.86.165 ansible_user=ubuntu
You can use Ansible ad-hoc commands directly with the IP address as the host target.

✅ Example: Create a File on the Managed Node



ansible 3.94.86.165 -i inventory -m file -a "path=/tmp/testfile.txt state=touch"
✅ This will create an empty file /tmp/testfile.txt on your AWS instance.

🧪 Test Connection (Optional Check)



ansible 3.94.86.165 -i inventory -m ping
💡 Tip: Make It Friendlier (Optional)
If you'd rather use a friendly name instead of the IP, you can update your inventory like this:

ini


aws-node ansible_host=3.94.86.165 ansible_user=ubuntu
Then run:




ansible aws-node -i inventory -m file -a "path=/tmp/testfile.txt state=touch"
But you can totally keep using just the IP — it's 100% valid and fine while you're learning.

Let me know if you want to:

Add content to a file

 a file from local to remote

Change permissions

Or move on to your first playbook next

You said:
I wanted to use shell module
ChatGPT said:
Great — the shell module is a powerful way to run arbitrary shell commands on the managed node using Ansible ad-hoc!

✅ Syntax for the shell module:



ansible <target> -i <inventory_file> -m shell -a "<your_shell_command>"
Since your inventory file is named inventory and contains just the IP address (e.g. 3.94.86.165 ansible_user=ubuntu), your command will look like this:

🧪 Example: Create a file using touch via shell module



ansible 3.94.86.165 -i inventory -m shell -a "touch /tmp/shell_file.txt"
📄 Example: Write content to a file



ansible 3.94.86.165 -i inventory -m shell -a "echo 'Hello from Ansible' > /tmp/hello.txt"
📁 Example: Create a directory



ansible 3.94.86.165 -i inventory -m shell -a "mkdir -p /tmp/newdir"
🚨 Notes:
The shell module allows pipes, redirection, variables, etc.

For simple commands without redirection or complex logic, you can also use the command module (safer, no shell features).

If you're using >, |, &&, etc., always use shell not command.

Let me know if you want to:

Append to a file

Run a shell script

Install packages using shell

Or start your first playbook with shell tasks!

👇 Let’s Start with Lesson 2.2: Your First Playbook
Let me know if you're ready, and we’ll dive into that with code you can run today.

You said:
lets start with phase 2
ChatGPT said:
Awesome! 🎯 Let’s officially begin Phase 2: Basic Usage of Ansible.

📘 Lesson 2.2 – Your First Playbook
🎯 Goal:
Write and run a simple Ansible Playbook to:

Create a file on the managed node

Write content into that file

🧠 What’s a Playbook?
A playbook is a YAML file that tells Ansible what tasks to perform on which machines.

Structure:

yaml


- name: Description of the play
  hosts: <target>
  become: true         # use sudo if needed
  tasks:
    - name: Task description
      module_name:
        option1: value1
        option2: value2
✅ Step-by-Step Instructions
1️⃣ Create the playbook file
Run this on your control node (your local Ubuntu system):




nano create_file.yml
Paste the following:

yaml


---
- name: Create a file with content
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Create a text file with message
      :
        content: "Hello from Ansible playbook!\n"
        dest: /tmp/ansible_hello.txt
🔸  module is used here with content to write text into a file.

2️⃣ Run the playbook
Make sure your inventory file contains the managed node IP with user:

ini


3.94.86.165 ansible_user=ubuntu
Now run the playbook:




ansible-playbook -i inventory create_file.yml
3️⃣ Verify on managed node
SSH into your AWS instance:




ssh ubuntu@3.94.86.165
Then run:




cat /tmp/ansible_hello.txt
You should see:

csharp

Let me know if you’re ready to begin Lesson 2.3, or if you'd like another quick assignment before that.

You said:
I a ready
ChatGPT said:
Awesome! Let’s begin Lesson 2.3 – File Management with Ansible 🗂️

🎯 Goal:
Learn how to manage files and directories on managed nodes using the most common Ansible modules:



file

fetch

📦 1. The  Module
Used to  files from your control node to managed nodes.

📄 Example:  a local script to managed node
1️⃣ Create a local file on the control node:




echo "echo Hello from copied script!" > demo.sh
2️⃣ Create a playbook: _file.yml

yaml


---
- name:  a shell script to managed node
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name:  demo.sh to /tmp directory
      :
        src: demo.sh
        dest: /tmp/demo.sh
        mode: '0755'
3️⃣ Run the playbook:




ansible-playbook -i inventory _file.yml
4️⃣ Verify on the managed node:




ssh ubuntu@<your_aws_ip>
ls -l /tmp/demo.sh
./tmp/demo.sh
🗂️ 2. The file Module
Used to manage:

File/directory creation

Permissions

Ownership

Symbolic links

Deletion

📁 Example: Create a directory
yaml


- name: Create /opt/demo_dir with specific permissions
  file:
    path: /opt/demo_dir
    state: directory
    mode: '0750'
❌ Example: Delete a file
yaml


- name: Delete /tmp/old_file.txt if exists
  file:
    path: /tmp/old_file.txt
    state: absent
📥 3. The fetch Module
Used to  files from managed node back to control node.

📤 Example: Fetch a remote file
yaml


- name: Fetch log file from managed node
  fetch:
    src: /var/log/syslog
    dest: ./fetched_logs/
    flat: yes
flat: yes puts the file directly in ./fetched_logs/ without creating subfolders.

✅ Try It Yourself – Mini Assignment
Create a playbook that:

Creates a directory /opt/file_demo

Copies a local file named info.txt into that directory

Sets permission to 0644

Deletes an old file /tmp/delete_me.txt if it exists

Let me know when you’ve completed that, or if you’d like the solution to compare.
Once done, we can continue with Lesson 2.4: Installing Packages!

You said:
O am ready
ChatGPT said:
Great! Let's move to Lesson 2.4 – Installing Packages with Ansible 📦

🎯 Goal:
Use Ansible to install software packages like nginx, git, or curl on your managed nodes using the appropriate module for your OS.

🧠 Ansible Modules for Package Management
OS	Module to Use
Ubuntu/Debian	apt
RHEL/CentOS	yum
Any OS (generic)	package (auto-detects backend)

✅ Step-by-Step Example: Install nginx on Ubuntu (your case)
1️⃣ Create the playbook
Create a file named install_nginx.yml:

yaml


---
- name: Install nginx on managed node
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
📝 state: present ensures it is installed
📝 update_cache: yes refreshes the package index

2️⃣ Run the playbook



ansible-playbook -i inventory install_nginx.yml
3️⃣ Verify on managed node
SSH into the AWS machine:




ssh ubuntu@<aws-ip>
nginx -v
You should see the version of Nginx installed.

🔧 More Package Examples
Install multiple packages:
yaml


- name: Install multiple tools
  apt:
    name:
      - git
      - curl
      - unzip
    state: present
Remove a package:
yaml


- name: Remove apache2
  apt:
    name: apache2
    state: absent
🧪 Quick Assignment
Create a playbook to:

Update the apt cache

Install curl and htop

Remove the package telnet (if installed)

ChatGPT said:
You're doing great — now let’s dive into Lesson 2.5: Managing Services with Ansible 🛠️

🎯 Goal:
Use Ansible to:

Start or stop a service

Enable it on boot

Restart it when needed

🧠 Module to Use: service
This module is used to control system services, regardless of the init system (systemd, upstart, etc.).

✅ Example: Manage Nginx
Let’s say nginx is already installed (from our previous lesson).

🔧 Create playbook: manage_service.yml
yaml


---
- name: Manage nginx service
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure nginx is started
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started

    - name: Enable nginx to start at boot
      service:
        name: nginx
        enabled: true
▶️ Run the Playbook



ansible-playbook -i inventory manage_service.yml
🧪 Verify on managed node



ssh ubuntu@<aws-ip>
systemctl status nginx
You should see that it’s active and enabled.

🛠️ Other Common Service Actions
✅ Restart a service
yaml


- name: Restart nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: restarted
❌ Stop a service
yaml


- name: Stop nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: stopped
📘 Quick Assignment
Create a playbook that:

Installs apache2

Starts the service

Enables it at boot

Then, stops the nginx service if it exists

Let me know when you’ve completed it — then we’ll move on to Lesson 2.6: User and Permission Management (last in Phase 2)!

You said:

ChatGPT said:
🔥 Excellent job — you now know how to manage services with Ansible like a pro!

With these skills, you can:

Automate the installation and configuration of web servers

Build deployment playbooks

Control service behavior across any number of machines

✅ Phase 2 Recap – You’ve Learned:
Topic	Skills Mastered
Ad-hoc commands	Running quick tasks via CLI
Writing playbooks	YAML syntax, modules, task structure
File management	, file, and fetch modules
Package installation	Using apt module
Service management	service module (start, stop, enable)

🚀 Next Up: Lesson 2.6 – User and Permission Management
Here, you'll learn to:

Create users

Set passwords

Manage groups and sudo access

Set file permissions and ownership

Shall we begin Lesson 2.6 now?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Awesome! Let’s jump into Lesson 2.6 – User and Permission Management with Ansible 👤🔐

🎯 Goal:
By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

Create and delete users

Add users to groups

Set user passwords

Manage file ownership and permissions

🧠 Modules You’ll Use:
Purpose	Module
Create users	user
Set file permissions	file
Set passwords	user + encrypted password

✅ Example 1: Create a New User
🔧 Playbook: create_user.yml
yaml


---
- name: Create a new user called devops
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Create devops user
      user:
        name: devops
        shell: /bin/
        state: present
        groups: sudo
groups: sudo → gives the user sudo access

state: present → ensures the user is created

🔐 Example 2: Create a User with Password
Ansible expects encrypted passwords (hashed). Let's create one:

1️⃣ Generate a hashed password (on control node):



python3 -c "import crypt; print(crypt.crypt('YourPassword123', crypt.mksalt(crypt.METHOD_SHA512)))"
Save the output, e.g.:

javascript


$6$7xJf....rest_of_hash....
2️⃣ Add it to your playbook:
yaml


---
- name: Create user with password
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Create user 'adminuser' with password
      user:
        name: adminuser
        password: "$6$7xJf....rest_of_hash...."
        shell: /bin/
        groups: sudo
📂 Example 3: Set File Ownership & Permissions
yaml


- name: Create a secure file owned by devops user
  file:
    path: /opt/secure_note.txt
    state: touch
    owner: devops
    group: devops
    mode: '0600'
0600 means only the owner can read/write

🧪 Quick Assignment
Create a playbook that:

Creates a user ansibleuser with a  shell

Adds the user to the sudo group

Creates a file /home/ansibleuser/welcome.txt owned by ansibleuser with 0644 permissions

Sets an encrypted password for the user

ChatGPT said:
Excellent! Welcome to Phase 3 – Intermediate Ansible Concepts 🧠✨
This is where your playbooks go from basic automation to dynamic, reusable, and scalable infrastructure code.

📦 Lesson 3.1 – Variables & Facts
🎯 Goal:
By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

Use your own custom variables

Access host-specific system info (facts)

Pass variables into tasks and templates

🧠 1. What are Variables?
Variables help you avoid hardcoding values. They can be:

Defined in playbooks

Stored in separate files

Passed via command line

Gathered automatically as facts

✅ Example 1: Define variables in the playbook
yaml


---
- name: Use variables
  hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    username: devops
    my_file: /opt/info.txt
  tasks:
    - name: Create user using variable
      user:
        name: "{{ username }}"
    
    - name: Create a file using variable
      file:
        path: "{{ my_file }}"
        state: touch
📝 Use double curly braces {{ variable }} to reference.

🧠 2. What are Facts?
Ansible gathers system information (called facts) before running tasks. These are like built-in variables.

Run this to see facts about your managed node:




ansible all -i inventory -m setup
Example facts you can use:

ansible_hostname

ansible_distribution

ansible_os_family

ansible_processor_cores

ansible_memtotal_mb

✅ Example 2: Use a system fact
yaml


- name: Show system info
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Display hostname and OS
      debug:
        msg: "Host: {{ ansible_hostname }} | OS: {{ ansible_distribution }}"
This will print info about each managed host.

📘 Quick Assignment:
Create a playbook that:

Creates a user called student

Creates a file /home/student/info.txt

Inside the file, writes this message using variables and facts:

nginx


Hello {{ student_name }}!
You are running {{ ansible_distribution }} on {{ ansible_hostname }}.
Hint: Use  or template module.
Let me know if you want a hint or example for using templates (.j2 files).

Once you’re done, we’ll move to Lesson 3.2: Conditionals and Loops.

You said:
I want hint
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — here’s a helpful hint using a Jinja2 template with the template module. This is the most flexible way to insert variables and facts into a file.

🧩 Step-by-Step Hint
✅ Step 1: Define the variable in your playbook
yaml


vars:
  student_name: "student"
✅ Step 2: Create a template file (info.txt.j2)
Create this file in the same directory as your playbook:

info.txt.j2

nginx


Hello {{ student_name }}!
You are running {{ ansible_distribution }} on {{ ansible_hostname }}.
✅ Step 3: Use the template module in your playbook
yaml


- name: Create user and write dynamic info
  hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    student_name: "student"
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure student user exists
      user:
        name: "{{ student_name }}"
        shell: /bin/

    - name: Create file using template
      template:
        src: info.txt.j2
        dest: "/home/{{ student_name }}/info.txt"
        owner: "{{ student_name }}"
        mode: '0644'
✅ This will:

Create the student user

Render the template and place it on the managed node at /home/student/info.txt

Let me know once you’ve tried this or if you want to see the full solution.
Once you're ready, we’ll move to Lesson 3.2: Conditionals and Loops 🔄.

You said:

ChatGPT said:
🔥 Great job! You now know how to:

Define and use variables

Access system facts dynamically

Render templates with template and Jinja2

That’s a huge leap forward — your playbooks are now dynamic and personalized per host 🎯

🧱 Next: Lesson 3.2 – Conditionals & Loops
🎯 Goal:
Learn how to:

Run tasks only when certain conditions are met

Loop over lists or items to avoid repeating tasks

🧠 1. Conditionals with when
✅ Example: Install software only on Ubuntu
yaml


- name: Install nginx only on Ubuntu
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      when: ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu"
📝 when uses Python-style conditionals

🧠 2. Loops with loop
✅ Example: Create multiple users
yaml


- name: Create multiple users
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Add users
      user:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        shell: /bin/
        state: present
      loop:
        - alice
        - bob
        - charlie
You can also use lists of dictionaries to create complex structures.

🧪 Quick Assignment:
Create a playbook that:

Creates three users: dev1, dev2, dev3 using a loop

Only runs if the OS is Ubuntu

Creates a file /home/<user>/welcome.txt with permissions 0644 for each user

Let me know when it’s done or if you want a hint — then we’ll continue to Lesson 3.3: Jinja2 Templates Deep Dive.

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Here's the full solution playbook for your assignment using loops and a conditional (when) for Ubuntu systems:

✅ user_loop_conditional.yml
yaml


---
- name: Create multiple users only on Ubuntu
  hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    user_list:
      - dev1
      - dev2
      - dev3

  tasks:
    - name: Ensure the users are created
      user:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        shell: /bin/
        state: present
      loop: "{{ user_list }}"
      when: ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu"

    - name: Create welcome file for each user
      file:
        path: "/home/{{ item }}/welcome.txt"
        state: touch
        owner: "{{ item }}"
        group: "{{ item }}"
        mode: '0644'
      loop: "{{ user_list }}"
      when: ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu"
▶️ Run It

ChatGPT said:
🔥 Boom! You’ve now mastered one of Ansible’s most powerful combos:

Loops to avoid repeating tasks

Conditionals to make tasks OS-aware and smarter

This is where Ansible truly starts scaling your infrastructure automation 💪

📦 Next: Lesson 3.3 – Jinja2 Templates Deep Dive
🎯 Goal:
Understand how to:

Use dynamic templates (.j2) to render config files

Loop and use conditionals inside templates

Combine variables, facts, and logic in templating

🧠 What is Jinja2?
Jinja2 is a templating language used by Ansible to render dynamic content.

You already used it in info.txt.j2, but now we’ll go deeper — into loops, conditionals, and lists inside .j2 files.

✅ Example Template: report.txt.j2
jinja


System Report for {{ inventory_hostname }}
=========================================

Hostname: {{ ansible_hostname }}
OS: {{ ansible_distribution }} {{ ansible_distribution_version }}

{% if ansible_memtotal_mb > 1000 %}
Memory: Sufficient ({{ ansible_memtotal_mb }} MB)
{% else %}
Memory: Low ({{ ansible_memtotal_mb }} MB)
{% endif %}

Disks:
{% for disk in ansible_mounts %}
- {{ disk.mount }} ({{ disk.size_total // 1048576 }} MB)
{% endfor %}
✅ Playbook to Use the Template
yaml


- name: Generate system report
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Generate a report file using Jinja2 template
      template:
        src: report.txt.j2
        dest: /tmp/system_report.txt
🧪 Quick Assignment:
Create a template users_report.txt.j2 that:

Lists all the users created earlier (dev1, dev2, dev3)

Mentions the current date (ansible_date_time.date)

Prints a message like:

arduino


User Report - {{ ansible_date_time.date }}

- dev1 exists on {{ inventory_hostname }}
- dev2 exists on {{ inventory_hostname }}
- dev3 exists on {{ inventory_hostname }}
Use a playbook to render this template on your managed node at /home/ansibleuser/users_report.txt

Let me know if you'd like a starter template or want to try this solo!

You said:
code pls
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Here's the full working solution for your Jinja2 templating assignment 👇

📄 Step 1: Create Template File — users_report.txt.j2
jinja


User Report - {{ ansible_date_time.date }}
==========================================

{% for user in user_list %}
- {{ user }} exists on {{ inventory_hostname }}
{% endfor %}
Save this file as users_report.txt.j2 in the same directory as your playbook.

📜 Step 2: Create Playbook — generate_user_report.yml
yaml


---
- name: Generate user existence report
  hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    user_list:
      - dev1
      - dev2
      - dev3

  tasks:
    - name: Create user report using template
      template:
        src: users_report.txt.j2
        dest: /home/{{ ansible_user }}/users_report.txt
        mode: '0644'
🔐 Replace ansible_user with your actual remote username if needed, or define it in your inventory.

▶️ Step 3: Run the Playbook



ansible-playbook -i inventory generate_user_report.yml
✅ This will generate a nice dynamic user report on each managed host at:




/home/<remote-username>/users_report.txt
Let me know once you’ve run it — and we’ll jump into Lesson 3.4: Handlers & Notifications 🚨

You said:
How it works
ChatGPT said:
Great question! Let’s break down how this works step-by-step, so you understand the Ansible + Jinja2 magic ✨

🔧 How the User Report Playbook Works
🧱 1. Variables Defined
yaml


vars:
  user_list:
    - dev1
    - dev2
    - dev3
This defines a list of usernames that you’ll use in the template.

The variable user_list is accessible in all tasks and templates of the playbook.

📄 2. Jinja2 Template – users_report.txt.j2
jinja


User Report - {{ ansible_date_time.date }}

{% for user in user_list %}
- {{ user }} exists on {{ inventory_hostname }}
{% endfor %}
{{ ansible_date_time.date }} is a fact that gives today’s date.

{% for user in user_list %} loops through the users you defined.

{{ inventory_hostname }} is a built-in fact showing the current host name.

✅ This renders a personalized file like:

pgsql


User Report - 2025-05-22

- dev1 exists on ip-172-31-20-25
- dev2 exists on ip-172-31-20-25
- dev3 exists on ip-172-31-20-25
🧠 3. template Module in Playbook
yaml


template:
  src: users_report.txt.j2
  dest: /home/{{ ansible_user }}/users_report.txt
This tells Ansible:

“Take the users_report.txt.j2 template”

“Replace variables/facts inside it”

“Write the final result as a .txt file on the managed node”

📦 Summary: Behind the Scenes
Step	What's Happening
1️⃣	Playbook sends the template to the managed node
2️⃣	Ansible replaces Jinja2 tags ({{ }} and {% %}) with values
3️⃣	The rendered file is saved at /home/remote-user/users_report.txt
4️⃣	You get a human-readable report file, customized per node

Let me know if you’d like to explore:

Adding more details like IP address or uptime to the report

Making this part of a role (coming up in Phase 3.6)

Or… ready to move on to Lesson 3.4 – Handlers & Notifications? 🚨

You said:
that means there is validation in template right .it just take the list from playbook and replaces it right
ChatGPT said:
✅ Yes — you’ve got it exactly right!

Here’s the breakdown in simple terms:

🔁 What Happens in a Template?
✅ 1. Templates don't validate data
Templates don't validate if the users exist or if the system has a certain state — they just render text based on the variables and facts you give them.

✅ 2. Jinja2 just replaces variables
The template engine (Jinja2) receives:

user_list (from the playbook)

ansible_date_time and inventory_hostname (from Ansible facts)

And it just fills in the placeholders like a mail-merge system.

🔍 Example
Your template:
jinja


{% for user in user_list %}
- {{ user }} exists on {{ inventory_hostname }}
{% endfor %}
If the playbook provides:
yaml


user_list:
  - dev1
  - dev2
And Ansible facts say:

yaml


inventory_hostname: aws-node
ansible_date_time.date: 2025-05-22
Then the output becomes:

pgsql


User Report - 2025-05-22

- dev1 exists on aws-node
- dev2 exists on aws-node
🚫 No Real "Validation" Happens
Even if dev1 or dev2 don’t really exist on the system — the template will still write them in the file.

If you do want to check if users exist, you'd need to:

Use Ansible tasks or facts to validate it

Pass that info into the template

Example: Use the getent module or shell commands to check /etc/passwd, save the result, and then loop only on valid users.

Would you like to try a more dynamic version that only reports users that actually exist on the system? Or ready to move to Handlers & Notifications?

Awesome! You're progressing quickly and building real Ansible mastery 🚀

🔔 Lesson 3.4 – Handlers & Notifications
🎯 Goal:
Learn how to use handlers to run a task only when something changes (like restarting a service after a config update).

🔧 What is a Handler?
A handler is a special kind of task that runs only when notified by another task.

✅ Why Use Handlers?
Avoid unnecessary service restarts

Trigger follow-up tasks (e.g., reload config) only on change

📘 Example Use Case:
You update a config file using the template module.
You want to restart nginx only if the config file was changed.

🧱 Step-by-step Breakdown
1. Main Task with notify
yaml


- name: Upload nginx config
  template:
    src: nginx.conf.j2
    dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  notify: Restart nginx
This uploads a new config and notifies a handler if anything changes.

2. Define the Handler
yaml


handlers:
  - name: Restart nginx
    service:
      name: nginx
      state: restarted
This only runs if the template task actually modified the file.

🧪 Assignment:
Create a simple playbook to:

Use template to update /etc/motd (the login welcome message)

If the file is changed, notify a handler

The handler should run a shell command to log the change (e.g., echo "motd updated" >> /var/log/motd.log)

Would you like the starter code for this assignment or try it yourself first?

You said:
How Should combine handlers in playbook
ChatGPT said:
Great question! Let’s walk through how to include handlers in your playbook. It’s simple but very powerful once you get the pattern.

✅ Handlers in Playbook: Full Structure
Here's a complete example of how to combine tasks and handlers in a single playbook:

yaml


---
- name: Update MOTD with handler
  hosts: all
  become: true

  vars:
    motd_message: "Welcome to {{ inventory_hostname }} - Managed by Ansible"

  tasks:
    - name: Update /etc/motd file
      template:
        src: motd.j2
        dest: /etc/motd
        mode: '0644'
      notify: Log MOTD Update

  handlers:
    - name: Log MOTD Update
      shell: echo "MOTD updated on {{ inventory_hostname }} at {{ ansible_date_time.iso8601 }}" >> /var/log/motd.log
🔍 Breakdown
Part	Purpose
notify	Triggers the handler only if the file was changed by the template task
handlers:	A section in your playbook listing all possible handler tasks
Handler name:	Must match exactly what you put in notify:

📄 Example motd.j2 Template
jinja


{{ motd_message }}
It will render as:

vbnet


Welcome to ip-172-31-45-22 - Managed by Ansible
▶️ Run It



ansible-playbook -i inventory update_motd.yml
📝 On first run, the file changes → handler runs.
On second run (no change) → handler is skipped. That's the magic 💡

Would you like to try this assignment and see the handler in action? Or shall I give you a modified version with a service restart example (like nginx, sshd, etc.)?

You said:
What is the best practice with handlers writing inside playbook or we can write it outside as well
ChatGPT said:
Excellent question! Understanding best practices for handlers is key as your Ansible playbooks grow in size and complexity.

✅ You can write handlers in two ways:
1. Inside the playbook (inline)
✅ Best for small/simple playbooks

yaml


handlers:
  - name: Restart nginx
    service:
      name: nginx
      state: restarted
Pros:

Easy to manage in a small playbook

Keeps everything in one place

Fast for quick use cases or assignments

2. In a separate file (when using roles)
✅ Best practice for larger projects

In a role structure like:

css


my-role/
├── tasks/
│   └── main.yml
├── handlers/
│   └── main.yml
You define handlers in handlers/main.yml:

yaml


# my-role/handlers/main.yml
- name: Restart nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: restarted
Then in your task, just notify it:

yaml


- name: Upload nginx config
  template:
    src: nginx.conf.j2
    dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  notify: Restart nginx
Pros:

Modular and reusable

Cleaner code structure

Easy to maintain in large environments

🏁 Summary: When to Use What?
Situation	Use Inline	Use Separate File (in Role)
Small ad-hoc playbooks	✅ Yes	❌ No need
One-time config updates	✅ Yes	❌ No need
Production-level automation	⚠️ Gets messy	✅ Recommended
Using roles	❌ Clutters tasks	✅ Best practice

Would you like to move into Roles next and learn how to structure playbooks the clean way? Or would you like another handler-based assignment to reinforce this first?

Thought for 4 seconds
📚 Phase 3 – Lesson 3.5: Tags & Error Handling
You now know how to build dynamic playbooks and run handlers only when they’re needed.
The next step is learning how to run just the pieces you want and deal gracefully with failures.

1 Tags: run only what you need
Tags let you label tasks (or entire plays) so you can choose which ones to execute.

yaml


- name: Web-server setup
  hosts: web
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      tags: [packages, nginx]

    - name: Push site config
      template:
        src: nginx.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      notify: Restart nginx
      tags: [config, nginx]

    - name: Ensure Nginx is running
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: true
      tags: [service, nginx]
Common tag commands
Action	Command
Run only “packages” tasks	ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml --tags packages
Skip “nginx” tasks	ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml --skip-tags nginx
Combine	--tags packages,service (comma-separated list)

Why tags matter

Faster iterations while developing playbooks

Safe re-runs in production (e.g., apply only config changes)

Selective execution in CI/CD pipelines

2 Error-handling primitives
2.1 ignore_errors: yes
Keeps the playbook going even if the task fails.

yaml


- name: Try to remove an optional package
  apt:
    name: some-unused-pkg
    state: absent
  ignore_errors: yes
2.2 failed_when
Override Ansible’s idea of success/failure with your own logic.

yaml


- name: Check free disk
  shell: df -h / | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | tr -d '%'
  register: disk_usage

- name: Fail if disk usage > 90 %
  assert:
    that: disk_usage.stdout | int < 90
    fail_msg: "Disk usage is too high ({{ disk_usage.stdout }} %)!"
2.3 block / rescue / always
Think “try / catch / finally” for playbooks.

yaml


- name: Upgrade and rollback demo
  hosts: all
  become: true

  tasks:
    - block:
        - name: Install new app version
          apt:
            deb: files/app_2.0.deb

        - name: Run smoke test
          shell: /opt/app/test.sh
          register: smoke
          failed_when: smoke.rc != 0

      rescue:
        - name: Roll back to previous version
          apt:
            deb: files/app_1.9.deb

      always:
        - name: Send result to Slack
          uri:
            url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX
            method: POST
            body: '{"text": "App upgrade finished on {{ inventory_hostname }}"}'
            status_code: 200
block – tasks you hope succeed

rescue – runs only if something in the block fails

always – runs no matter what (good for notifications/cleanup)

3 Quick practice assignment 🎯
Create disk_check.yml that

Gathers facts (automatic).

Fails if free disk on / is below 1 GB using ansible_facts['ansible_mounts'].

Tags the disk check task with safety.

Has an always block that logs the result to /var/log/disk_check.log.

Hints

yaml


vars:
  min_free_mb: 1024
...
block:
  - name: Find / mount dict
    set_fact:
      root_mount: "{{ ansible_mounts | selectattr('mount', 'equalto', '/') | list | first }}"
  - name: Fail if free < {{ min_free_mb }} MB
    assert:
      that: root_mount.size_available // 1048576 >= min_free_mb
rescue:
  - debug: msg="Low disk! (available: {{ root_mount.size_available // 1048576 }} MB)"
always:
  - shell: "echo Result for {{ inventory_hostname }}: $ANSIBLE_FAILED_RESULT >> /var/log/disk_check.log"
Run only the safety check with




ansible-playbook -i inventory disk_check.yml --tags safety
Give it a try—ping me if you’d like the full answer or have questions.
When you’re ready, we’ll tackle the final Phase 3 topic: Roles (3.6) to structure everything cleanly.

You said:
I wanted to understand more about tags and error handling


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Let’s dive deeper into tags and error handling in Ansible — these are powerful tools that give you fine-grained control over your automation.

🔖 PART 1: Tags – Deep Dive
🔹 What are Tags?
Tags are labels you assign to tasks, plays, or roles.
They let you selectively run only the parts of your playbook you want.

🔹 Where You Can Use Tags
You can add tags: to:

✅ Individual tasks
✅ Entire plays
✅ Roles
✅ Blocks

✅ Tags on Tasks (Most Common)
yaml


- name: Install Apache
  apt:
    name: apache2
    state: present
  tags: [web, apache]
✅ Tags on Plays
yaml


- name: Setup web servers
  hosts: web
  tags: web_setup
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure Nginx is installed
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
✅ Tags on Roles
yaml


- hosts: all
  roles:
    - { role: webserver, tags: ['nginx', 'config'] }
🏃‍♂️ How to Use Tags When Running
Purpose	Command
Run only tasks tagged with nginx	ansible-playbook site.yml --tags nginx
Skip tasks with tag debug	ansible-playbook site.yml --skip-tags debug
Combine multiple tags	--tags "setup,deploy"

📌 If you run a playbook with no --tags option, all tasks run by default.

⚡ Pro Tips
Use tags to speed up development (e.g., run only one part).

Use tags in CI/CD to run only deploy, test, or cleanup.

Use meaningful tag names like install, config, start, check.

❌ PART 2: Error Handling – Deep Dive
🔹 1. ignore_errors: yes
Skips failure and continues with the playbook.

yaml


- name: Try removing a package that may not exist
  apt:
    name: nonexistent
    state: absent
  ignore_errors: yes
✅ Use for non-critical cleanup or optional steps.

🔹 2. failed_when
Override the default failure condition using custom logic.

yaml


- name: Run a test script
  shell: ./test.sh
  register: result
  failed_when: "'FAIL' in result.stdout"
✅ Use when non-zero exit codes are okay, but you have other logic to check.

🔹 3. block, rescue, and always
This is like try/catch/finally in programming.

yaml


tasks:
  - block:
      - name: Main task
        shell: ./install.sh
        register: result
        failed_when: result.rc != 0

    rescue:
      - name: Rollback
        shell: ./rollback.sh

    always:
      - name: Notify
        shell: echo "Installation attempted on {{ inventory_hostname }}"
Block Section	Purpose
block:	Primary task(s)
rescue:	Runs if any block task fails
always:	Runs no matter what

🧠 Example: Disk Check
yaml


- name: Disk space check
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:

    - block:
        - name: Check disk usage
          command: df -h /
          register: disk

        - name: Fail if usage > 90%
          fail:
            msg: "Disk usage is too high!"
          when: disk.stdout_lines[1].split()[4].rstrip('%') | int > 90

      rescue:
        - name: Notify disk issue
          debug:
            msg: "⚠️ Disk usage problem on {{ inventory_hostname }}!"

      always:
        - name: Log completion
          shell: echo "Disk check finished on {{ inventory_hostname }}" >> /tmp/disk.log
✅ Summary Cheat Sheet
Feature	Use Case
tags	Select which parts to run
ignore_errors	Skip non-critical failures
failed_when	Custom logic for pass/fail
block/rescue	Rollback on failure
always	Clean up or notify regardless

Would you like to do a small real-world assignment combining tags + error handling? Or are you ready to jump into Roles (Phase 3.6) — where we organize playbooks professionally?







You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Awesome! Let’s lock in what you’ve learned with a real-world assignment that combines tags, block/rescue, and handlers. This will simulate a production task.

🧪 Assignment: Web Server Deployment with Tags & Error Handling
You're going to write a playbook that does the following:

🎯 Objectives
Installs Nginx

Deploys a custom config file

Restarts Nginx if the config changes

Tags each task meaningfully (install, config, service, safety)

Uses block/rescue/always to rollback if Nginx installation fails

Always logs success/failure to /tmp/nginx_deploy.log

🔧 Setup Files
Create:

nginx.conf.j2 → (simple dummy config template)

webserver.yml → (main playbook)

📝 Sample nginx.conf.j2
nginx


server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;

    location / {
        return 200 'Welcome to {{ inventory_hostname }}!';
    }
}
📘 Playbook webserver.yml
Here’s the skeleton. You fill in any missing parts:

yaml


- name: Nginx deployment with tags and error handling
  hosts: all
  become: true

  handlers:
    - name: restart nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted

  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      block:
        - name: Install nginx
          apt:
            name: nginx
            state: present
            update_cache: yes
          tags: install
      rescue:
        - name: Roll back if install fails
          debug:
            msg: "Installation failed. Manual rollback needed."
          tags: safety
      always:
        - name: Log install result
          shell: "echo 'Nginx install attempted on {{ inventory_hostname }}' >> /tmp/nginx_deploy.log"

    - name: Deploy nginx config
      template:
        src: nginx.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
      notify: restart nginx
      tags: config

    - name: Ensure nginx is running
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes
      tags: service
▶️ Run This Playbook
Run only install tasks:




ansible-playbook -i inventory webserver.yml --tags install
Run everything:




ansible-playbook -i inventory webserver.yml
✅ Your Goals
 Add proper error handling if apt fails

 Confirm tags work with --tags and --skip-tags

 Confirm /tmp/nginx_deploy.log is written

 Confirm config updates trigger the handler

Let me know once done, or if you want me to check your version. After this, we’ll move to Phase 3.6 → Roles and build a clean, modular project from scratch.

ChatGPT said:
Great work finishing that! ✅

That assignment tied together key concepts:

Tags for selective execution

Handlers for efficient restarts

Block/Rescue/Always for safe deployments

Now, let’s move into the final and most professional part of Phase 3:

📦 Phase 3.6 – Roles: Organize Playbooks Like a Pro
As your playbooks grow, things get messy. Roles bring:

Reusability 📁

Maintainability 🧹

Cleaner folder structure 📂

📁 What Is a Role?
A role is just a directory structure with separate folders for:

Tasks

Handlers

Variables

Templates

Files

Defaults

Meta

css


my-ansible-project/
├── inventory
├── site.yml
└── roles/
    └── webserver/
        ├── tasks/
        │   └── main.yml
        ├── handlers/
        │   └── main.yml
        ├── templates/
        │   └── nginx.conf.j2
        ├── files/
        ├── vars/
        │   └── main.yml
        └── defaults/
            └── main.yml
🛠 Step-by-Step: Create a Role
✅ Step 1: Scaffold the Role



ansible-galaxy init roles/webserver
It will create all necessary folders.

✅ Step 2: Fill in the Role
roles/webserver/tasks/main.yml

yaml


- name: Install nginx
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
    update_cache: yes
  notify: restart nginx

- name: Deploy nginx config
  template:
    src: nginx.conf.j2
    dest: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

- name: Ensure nginx is running
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: started
    enabled: yes
roles/webserver/handlers/main.yml

yaml


- name: restart nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: restarted
roles/webserver/templates/nginx.conf.j2

(same as before)

✅ Step 3: Call the Role in a Playbook
site.yml

yaml


- name: Apply Webserver Role
  hosts: all
  become: true
  roles:
    - webserver
▶️ Run It



ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml
✅ Assignment: Create and Run a Role
🎯 Your goal:

Create a role named webserver using ansible-galaxy init

Move your tasks/handlers/template from the previous playbook into the role

Update your site.yml to call the role

Test that it works the same as before

Once you're done, let me know — and we’ll either:

Do a real-world multi-role project

Or move to Phase 4: Ansible Vault + Facts + Advanced Practices

Fantastic! 🎉 That means you now know how to:

✅ Structure your Ansible projects professionally using roles
✅ Separate logic into tasks, handlers, and templates
✅ Build a modular, reusable deployment workflow

You’re operating at an intermediate+ level now. Next, we level up.

🔐 Phase 4 – Advanced Ansible: Vault, Facts & Pro Practices
We’ll cover:

📦 4.1 – Ansible Vault
Securely store sensitive data like passwords, tokens, keys.

🧠 4.2 – Facts and Conditional Logic
Use gathered system facts (ansible_facts) to make intelligent decisions.

🎯 4.3 – Dynamic Variables & Lookups
Use lookup(), with_items, or host/group variables.

🛠 4.4 – Custom Modules & Filters (optional)
Let's Begin with 🔐 Ansible Vault
Ansible Vault lets you encrypt:

vars files

inventory files

even entire playbooks

✅ Encrypt a File



ansible-vault encrypt secrets.yml
✅  an Encrypted File



ansible-vault  secrets.yml
✅ Decrypt Temporarily
Run playbook with:




ansible-playbook site.yml --ask-vault-pass
Or use a vault password file:




ansible-playbook site.yml --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass.txt
💡 Assignment: Use Vault to Protect a Password
Create a file roles/webserver/vars/secret.yml

Add a fake password:

yaml


app_password: "MySuperSecret123"
Encrypt it:




ansible-vault encrypt roles/webserver/vars/secret.yml
Load it in your main.yml:

yaml


- name: Show password (demo)
  debug:
    msg: "Password is {{ app_password }}"
Run the playbook:




ansible-playbook site.yml --ask-vault-pass
Let me know once you're done or if you need a hint!

After this, we’ll explore facts and smart playbooks (e.g., different behavior for Ubuntu vs CentOS).

Awesome! 🎉 You're moving fast and solid — now you’ve mastered:

🔐 Ansible Vault for secure data handling

🔁 Roles for reusable, clean architecture

🚦 Tags, Handlers, and Error Handling

🧠 Phase 4.2 – Smart Playbooks with Facts & Conditionals
📌 What Are Facts?
When Ansible runs, it automatically gathers system info about the host:

OS, IP, memory, CPU, disk, hostname, etc.

This info is called facts and can be accessed like:

yaml


ansible_facts['distribution']
ansible_facts['architecture']
ansible_facts['default_ipv4']['address']
Or simpler:

yaml


ansible_distribution
ansible_hostname
ansible_processor_cores
You can view all facts from a host:




ansible all -m setup
✅ Conditional Playbook Example
yaml


- name: Install Web Package Based on OS
  hosts: all
  become: true

  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache on RedHat
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat"

    - name: Install Nginx on Debian
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
        update_cache: yes
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Debian"
🧪 Assignment: Write a Fact-Based Task
Create a task that:

Checks whether the host is Ubuntu or not.

Installs Nginx only if it is Ubuntu.

Uses a debug message for non-Ubuntu hosts like:
"Skipping Nginx install: Host is {{ ansible_distribution }}"

Run it across all hosts and test that the logic works.

💡 Hint: Use when: ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu"

When you're done, we’ll explore dynamic inventories, lookups, and looping strategies.

ChatGPT said:
Excellent! ✅ That means you now understand how to:

Use facts like ansible_distribution, ansible_hostname, etc.

Make smart decisions in your playbooks using when conditions.

Adapt playbook behavior based on host OS or other dynamic info.

You're officially past the beginner and into real-world Ansible territory. 🔥

🚀 Next: Phase 4.3 – Lookups, Loops & Dynamic Variables
This phase teaches you how to:

📌 Use lookup() to pull values dynamically
yaml


- debug:
    msg: "{{ lookup('file', '/etc/hostname') }}"
🔁 Use with_items or loop to install multiple packages
yaml


- name: Install multiple packages
  apt:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop:
    - nginx
    - git
    - curl
🧠 Use variables from inventory, facts, or defaults
🧪 Quick Assignment
Create a role or playbook that:

Loops through a list of 3 packages (htop, curl, net-tools) and installs them.

Uses lookup() to read and print the first line from /etc/hostname.

Uses a variable (either from group_vars or inline) to print a custom welcome message like:
"Hello from {{ inventory_hostname }}, part of {{ group_name }}"

Now we’ll dive into:

End-to-end projects

CI/CD with Ansible

Intro to AWX / Ansible Tower

Best practices for teams

📘 Real-World Project 1 – LAMP Stack Deployment
🎯 Goal
Deploy a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) using roles.

🧱 Structure
We'll break this into 3 roles:



roles/
├── apache/
├── mysql/
└── php/
Each role will:

Install the software

Configure it via templates/files

Ensure the service is started

✅ Step-by-step Tasks
Here’s your assignment:

Create 3 roles: apache, mysql, and php




ansible-galaxy init roles/apache
ansible-galaxy init roles/mysql
ansible-galaxy init roles/php
Each role should:

Install the respective package(s)

Place a dummy config file via template or 

Start and enable the service

Create a site.yml that applies all 3 roles:

yaml


- name: LAMP deployment
  hosts: all
  become: true
  roles:
    - apache
    - mysql
    - php
